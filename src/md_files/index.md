  ![hello](/assets/favicons/himafava.png)

  hi everynyan! it's me olive olivemoment. i made a website cuz i think telling people i have a .com site is pretty cool. this page used to redirect to a straw page. unfortunately the new setup will not have gimmicks for now.... i'm sure it's easy to make but i'm lazy. i'm not really sure what i should do with this right now? 
  
  btw go check out [oomf chans website](https://foid.ca) she is making it using the same resources and setup as me cuz neither of us know what we're doing so we're just ping ponging off each other \^_^ 
  
  if you think this website is cool and awesome give me a thumbs up through the screen and follow me... MY SOCIAL MEDIAS ARE AVAILABLE ON MY [ABOUT!](/about) yayyyy!!!!!!
